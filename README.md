Machine Learning Pipeline: Process Overview
================================================================================

This project implements a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline, covering:
- data loading
- data cleaning
- feature engineering
- model construction
- model training
- hyperparameter tuning
- testing of tuned models
- feature prioritization

Below is a walkthrough of the logical flow and each module's role.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. data_loading.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module contains functions to import the raw dataset, for example from CSV
or Excel. The imported data is converted to a pandas DataFrame to provide a
consistent interface for downstream processing. Think of this module as the
central gatekeeper for all raw data inputs, ensuring that any future changes in
data source only require you to edit this one file, keeping the rest of the
pipeline intact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. data_cleaning.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After loading, raw data typically contains missing values, duplicates, or
incorrect types. This module systematically handles those issues. It may:
- drop duplicates
- fill or impute missing values
- convert data types (e.g., categorical encodings)
- remove obviously corrupted rows
The functions here take a raw DataFrame and return a "clean" one ready for
feature engineering and modeling. By isolating cleaning, the code stays modular
and easier to debug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. technical_engineering.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file supports technical feature engineering, meaning transformations to
enhance the dataset. It might include:
- one-hot encoding for categoricals
- polynomial feature expansions
- feature scaling or normalization
- custom domain-based features
Transformations happen here after cleaning but before model training. Well-
engineered features tend to improve model performance significantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. modeling.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module defines the ML model itself. It is separated out so you can change
model type (e.g., RandomForest to XGBoost or a neural net) without touching
data handling or training code. Often, you will find a function like
`create_model()` in this module, returning an untrained model object ready to
be fit on data. Centralizing this logic encourages experimentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. training.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module takes the cleaned and engineered data, splits it into training and
validation/test subsets, fits the model, and evaluates performance on those
splits. It handles the actual `.fit()` and `.predict()` calls, and records
performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, etc.). If you want to track overfitting
or plot learning curves, do it here. In a production workflow, this is where
you would also persist the trained model to disk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. tuning.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine learning models often need parameter tuning to perform optimally. This
module performs systematic searches over a hyperparameter space, for example
using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV, to find the best combination of
parameters. By keeping this logic separate, you can reuse the same tuning code
across different models with minimal edits. After tuning, the best parameters
are reported for use in final evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. tuningtest.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After finding optimal hyperparameters, you need to verify they work on truly
unseen data. This module tests the tuned model, helping detect any overfitting
that may have occurred during hyperparameter search. Essentially, it is a
final validation layer to confirm generalizability before deploying or drawing
conclusions about performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. prioritise_features.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module helps rank feature importance, using methods like feature importances
from tree models, permutation importance, or SHAP values. It allows you to
identify which features matter most, so you can:
- simplify the model
- interpret the results
- focus on key variables
This prioritization step is particularly useful for business or scientific
explanations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. main.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script coordinates the entire workflow:
- calls data loading functions
- runs cleaning
- applies feature engineering
- defines and builds the model
- trains the model
- tunes the hyperparameters
- tests the tuned model
- prioritizes features
This top-level script serves as the *orchestrator* of the whole process. If
someone wants to run the entire pipeline end-to-end, they execute `main.py`.
This guarantees reproducibility, since every step is called in a consistent
sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load raw data (data_loading.py)
2. Clean data (data_cleaning.py)
3. Engineer features (technical_engineering.py)
4. Define the model (modeling.py)
5. Train the model (training.py)
6. Tune hyperparameters (tuning.py)
7. Test the tuned model (tuningtest.py)
8. Prioritize features (prioritise_features.py)
9. Orchestrate everything (main.py)

This design is modular, so you can:
- swap in new models
- adjust features
- change hyperparameter strategies
with minimal disruption to the rest of the pipeline. In short, it supports
clean, extensible, and reproducible machine learning experimentation.
